## Growth Mindset @ TIY

***

The [brainpickings article on growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/ "Growth Mindset") reflects a bit of the thinking that went into my decision to attend The Iron Yard. I hope to keep up with that type of thinking throughout the next twelve weeks, and further - into my new career in programming.

I know that I don't know very much about programming in Java. That is *why I'm here.* I won't be able to change careers on the back of

	System.out.println("Hello world!");

but the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. By giving as much effort as possible over these twelve weeks (and beyond), I am confident that I can learn and accomplish things I have never even imagined.

I disagree somewhat with the concept of improving weaknesses rather than excelling at strengths - just look at Michael Jordan's decision to leave the NBA for AA baseball - but I am confident with a lot of effort, I could at least become the Brian Scalabrine of coding.

I hope that all four of us work through this course with an open mind and an eagerness to learn, and I'm sure we can all succeed with some hard work and cooperation.
